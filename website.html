            <img class="calculatorimage" src="https://www.ebuyer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/buttons-on-a-calculator-title.jpg" alt="Calculator Image" width="33%" align="right"<p class="p"> <h3>Information</h3> A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. Many say that JavaScript programming code plays the most significant role in making calculators. So I made a calculator that was made using only HTML programming code. Here a small amount of CSS programming code has been used to design. From this article, you will learn how to make a calculator using a very small amount of HTML programming code. The calculator shown here works exactly like a normal calculator.

                Basically here you can easily solve any kind of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. mathematics calculations. Different types of buttons have been used here and they have been designed using CSS code. I have designed many more types of calculators before, such as Casio Company, neumorphism, Responsive, etc. But this design is completely new and common. In this article, you will find all kinds of necessary source codes and tutorials that will help you create this new design.
